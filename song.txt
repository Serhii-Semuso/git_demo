I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me...
And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me

Tonight
I wanna see it in your eyes
Feel the magic
There's something that drives me wild
And tonight we're gonna make it all come true
'Cause girl, you were made for me
And girl, I was made for you
